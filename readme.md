# Flight Delay Prediction

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)<br>

## What It Does: 
This project aims to make use of **Machine Learning** techniques to predict the state of upcoming flight i.e it will be on time or delayed. The project performs the following tasks: <br>


1️⃣ Data Collection <br>
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing <br>
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
4️⃣ Dataset Balancing & Scaling <br>
5️⃣ Machine Learning Models Training & Evaluation

## Prerequisites:
I would highly recommend that before the hack night you have some kind of toolchain and development environment already installed and ready. If you have no idea where to start with this, try a combination like: <br>


1️⃣ `Python`<br>
2️⃣ `scikit-learn` / `sklearn`<br>
3️⃣ `Pandas`<br>
4️⃣ `NumPy`<br>
5️⃣ `Swaborn`<br>
6️⃣ An environment to work in - something like `Jupyter` or `colab`<br>

For Linux people, your package manager should be able to handle all of this. If it somehow can't, see if you can at least install Python and pip and then use pip to install the above packages.

## Dataset:
Airlines Dataset Inspired in the regression dataset from Elena Ikonomovska. The task is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.

> You can collect raw dataset from [here](airline_delay.csv).

Attribute Information:<br>
1️⃣ `Time` <br>
2️⃣ `Length` <br>
3️⃣ `Airline` <br>
4️⃣ `Airport From` <br>
5️⃣ `Airport To`<br>
6️⃣ `Day Of Week`
